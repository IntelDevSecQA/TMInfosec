Too Much Information in Security
================================
List of webistes related to information security that I have kept track of since I began in infosec 4 years ago as well as some sites I had found while a system/windows admin before I knew how to spell "infosec".

This repo contains the following:
* Reputation -- websites that have information related to malware/nefarious reputations for ip/domains/hashes/ssl-certs/etc. For example use these for searching your indicator on the site to see if you can glean any more information related to that IOC.
* NonReputation-Domain -- websites that you would use to gather information related to a domain.. Such as WhoIS information or PassiveDNS information
* LiveAnalysis -- websites that will allow you to submit files, urls, domains, IPs for sandboxing.. ie: online sandbox
* ETC -- websites for website categorization, malware pcap repos, internet scan websites.
* Blocklists -- Lists of domains that you can download in bulk/mass list. You could use these for a dns sinkhole/blackhole.. Contains malware, advertisements, spam, phishing, and dynamic dns domains.

You may notice many repetitive websites as many sites contain information for IPs & Domains & Hashes and a URL consists of a domain/IP.

Many of these sites are run by people in their spare time(for free) and the updates should be used at your own risk.  Kudos to all of these awesome infosec researchers!  Please don't blame your lack of verification on any of their mistakes..ie:accidentally including google .com because you have some sort of un-vetted auto block list.
If I, at 19 years old, was able to vet Alexa top million then you too can toooooo. Run helpdesk for a few days and you will understand why you too need to vet any auto block lists.

Let me know if I am missing anything!
