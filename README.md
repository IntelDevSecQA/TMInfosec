Too Much Information in Security
================================
Currently this repo contains a list of sites for malware/nefarious reputations for ip/domains/ssl-certs/file-hashes as well as things you would use for OSINT for something like domains and or their registrants and or internet scan databases.
Eventually I will add my blogs/rss feeds. This is the list I have created since I began in infosec 3-4 years ago as well as some sites I had found while a system/windows admin before I knew how to spell "infosec".

Many of these sites are run by people in their spare time(for free) and the updates should be used at your own risk.  Kudos to all of these awesome infosec researchers!  Please don't blame your lack of verification on any of their mistakes..ie:accidentally including google\.com because you have some sort of un-vetted auto block list. If I, at 19 years old, was able to vet Alexa top million then you too can toooooo. Run helpdesk for a few days and you will understand why you too need to vet any auto block lists.

You may notice many repetitive websites as many sites contain information for IPs & Domains & Hashes and a URL consists of a domain/IP.

Let me know if I am missing anything!
