Too Much Information in Security
================================
Currently this repo contains a list of sites for malware/nefarious reputations for ip/domains/ssl-certs/file-hashes as well as things you would use for OSINT for something like domains and or their registrants and or internet scan databases.
Eventually I will add my blogs/rss feeds.

Many of these sites are run by people in their spare time(for free) and the updates should be used at your own risk.  Kudos to all of these awesome infosec researchers!  Please don't blame your lack of research on any of their mistakes..ie:accidentally including google\.com because you have some sort of un-vetted auto block list.  Run helpdesk for a few days and you will understand why you need to vet any auto block lists.  If I was 19 as a one person shop running block lists and was able to vet Alexa top million then you too can toooooo.

You may notice many repetitive websites as many sites contain information for IPs & Domains & Hashes and a URL consists of a domain/IP.

Let me know if I am missing anything!
