* https://github.com/netzob/netzob -- tool for reverse engineering, traffic generation and fuzzing of communication protocols. This tool allows to infer the message format (vocabulary) and the state machine (grammar) of a protocol through passive and active processes. Its objective is to bring state of art academic researches to the operational field, by leveraging bio-informatic and grammatical inferring algorithms in a semi-automatic manner. Netzob is suitable for reversing network protocols, structured files and system and process flows (IPC and communication with drivers and devices). Once inferred, a protocol model can be used in our traffic generation engine, to allow simulation of realistic and controllable communication endpoints and flows. Netzob handles different types of protocols: text protocols (like HTTP and IRC), delimiter-based protocols, fixed fields protocols (like IP and TCP) and variable-length fields protocols (like TLV-based protocols).
